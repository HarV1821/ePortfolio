## How to Replicate

First you would need to create a repository on github. Once finished, head to the repository settings and look for the __Pages__ tab under __Code and Automation__ and then head to __Branch__ and select the drop down box, select the main branch and and then keep the rest of the settings and save. For the template that I used, you can install the template (or use a different template) on [html5up](/https://html5up.net) and then if you want you can also decide to combine the [bootstrap](/https://getbootstrap.com/) framework as well. Then adjust the elements inside the template as you wish. For my instance, I added my information into each of the sections. For the __Contact__ section I used [Formspree](/formspree.io) as a third party software to accept any incoming requests or messages in the format of a form and save their requests on the site itself. And then you should be able to replicate my ePortfolio!
